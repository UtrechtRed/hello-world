# hello-world
my first repository -- try out version
I'm a software developer for over 20 years, allways working on HP NonStop/Cobol/NonStop SQL. Also some experience with C and a little with Java. Worked also with OSS (posix shell for NonStop).
Now trying to learn Python and to get experience with it.
